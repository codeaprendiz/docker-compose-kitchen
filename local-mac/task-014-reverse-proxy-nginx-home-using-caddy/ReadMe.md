### We will try to understand how reverse proxy works.

- Nginx is running using docker-compose on container port 80 attached host port 8080 in network name 'host'
- Caddy is running using docker-compose port 80:80, 443:443 on the same network.
- Nginx home is serving "hello world from nginx"
- Caddy home is serving "hello world from caddy"
- Now when we hit [test.domain.com](test.domain.com) we would receive "hello world from nginx" by using reverse proxy. See caddy file for more details.
- You can login to the browser using 'username/username' which were generated by using the ansible-playbook `password-generation.yml`
